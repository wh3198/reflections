What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I have a repository? I presume I would do this with files where it is important to track version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Well its obviously half way between them.  I suppose it offers the ability to make decisions about how to group things and
provide a way to put them in a place in a group until you can decide what to do?  But if you are not sure enough on what to
do and what to commit then why take action yet.  To me the whole idea of a commit is you are either ready to make a decision
or you are not.  So seems to me like the staging area is more like a redundant place for the indecisive.  Not sure I see this
as useful.
